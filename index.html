        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
        <p>I am a Scientist at BD Genomics (which acquired my previous employer, Cellular Research) developing new RNA barcoding strategies, next generation sequencing library preparation methods, computational algorithms, and bioinformatics tools to analyze gene expression data of 100s to 1000s of single cells.  My passion is to tie the 'wet and dry' aspects genomics to discover new knowledge.  My work at BD Genomics has culminated over 10 pending patents, provisional patents, and invention disclosures. The majority of my data analysis is done using Python and R; I also create R Shiny apps to make genomics data exploration much more approachable for other scientists in the company.</p>
        
        <p>My research career began at the Johns Hopkins University, where I obtained my BS in Applied Mathematics and Statistics, followed by a MS in Molecular and Cellular Biology under the mentorship of Professor Haiqing Zhao and published a neuroscience paper in Proceedings to the National Academy of Sciences.</p>  
        
        <p>I performed my PhD thesis research in the laboratory of Miles Wilkinson at UC San Deigo to delineate the role of RNA regulation in neurodevelopmental and reproductive systems.  Even though I was a 'bench scientist' at graduate school, I became infatuated with the area of genomics and big data.  My first shot in genomics analysis - also our very traditional biology lab's first shot - was done while I was waiting for my mice to breed was published at Nucleic Acids Research in 2015 (joint first authorship with our amazing then-intern <a href="https://github.com/jolespin">Josh Espinoza</a>).  This experience has led me expand my work into data analysis - as showcased in my later papers in Cell, Cell Reports, and Stem Cell Reports - which eventually led to my employment at Cellular Research after graduate school.</p>
